# programming-mantra

Post a programming mantra to a slack channel of your choice. To use, clone this repo and setup a secret named `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` that contains the whole slack webhook url for your channel (including the protocol and the full path). Adjust the schedule in the workflow file if needed.
